      <h1>Rusty Ants</h1>
      <p>
        This is an implementation of the ant colony algorithm for solving the
        TSP. It simulates several independent agents that try to find the best
        tours. These “ants” make choices based on two inputs: how short an edge
        is, and how favourable it has been to other ants. In order to share the
        second type of information, each iteration the “ants” leave pheromones
        on the edges, in proportion to how successful their tour has been.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a computationally demanding algorithm, with O(n³) time complexity.
        A perfect use case for WebAssembly, it is written in Rust and compiled
        with the necessary glue code to run it and this demo page.
